			<h2>First Thoughts</h2>
			<p>Just been given the brief, and I’m feeling good about this year! Last year has given me a solid understanding of Unity to work from, so this year I can concentrate on ideation and iteration, rather than learning the very basics of Unity's functionality and syntax.</p>

			<p>I think that one of the more challenging aspects of this project will be the ideation step. Coming up with an idea that I feel is solid, takes time, and we only have about two weeks max. However, once I have that idea, I can start working. From there I think it should become a lot easier, as I can easily spend hours on a project I care about, and love every second of it.</p>

			<h2>Dead Ideas</h2>
			<p>Lots of ideas have past, none that I’m particularly enthused about. I do know however that I will be continuing to pursue 2D game development. I think that with the given timeframe, and the amount of work I need to achieve for most of my ideas, 2D will be the best option, as I can eliminate the need for 3D modelling and texturing, as well as a lot of rigging. So as of now, there have been no ideas set in stone.</p>

			<h2>Just in Time</h2>
			<p>I've been brainstorming ideas for good few days now, most idea are now gone and dead, but there was one in particular that I am keen to pursue!</p>

			<p>Trigger Finger is a 2D Competitive Action game that pits two players head to head, in quick best of five matches, where both players attempt to down one another. Players are only equipped with a single weapon, a knife, and a few consumables. The weapons have limited ammo, after which players will have to resort to using a knife. Consumables would include stationary shields, grenades and bounce pads. Players will be given a rank based on long term wins and losses.</p>

			<p>This game will be multiplayer only. I will have to learn about the technical side of matchmaking systems, apart from that I think that I have enough time to create a decent prototype to show off most of the game features.</p>

			<h2>Game Design Document</h2>
			<p>I've started on the GDD for Trigger Finger, and have approval from the lecturer to go ahead with the idea. I am keen to start working on this project, and will dediciate most of the next three days towards finishing up the GDD to an acceptable standard.</p>
			<p class="date">14/03/2018</p>

			<h2>Almost Finished</h2>
			<p>Most of the game design document is completed. I think I have a decent amount of detail, and clear explainations of game concepts and gameplay.
			I will continue to work on the GDD throughout tomorrow because I havn't done as much as I would like to today due to being sick. I will be adding some concept images of in-game items tomorrow as well.</p>

			<h2>Handed In GDD</h2>
			<p>Handed in the GDD this morning, i'm quite happy with how it turned out, I think I added a fair enough of detail and also created some 
			concept art which was also included. I'm keen to start project 2 this weekend and get an early start on prototype development.</p>
			<p class="date">16/03/2018</p>

			<h2>Solid Start</h2>
			<p>Today i'll be making a solid start on the second project. I never got around to starting earlier this weekend due to other more pressing deadlines as well as illness.</p>

			<h2>Core Mechanic Movement</h2>
			<p>The development of Trigger Finger is officially underway, and so is the idea of a new name.
			Currently I am working on the core mechanics, specifically the running, jumping and crouching mechanics, as they
			all need to be solid and robust. I'm also in the process of creating a small test map that will be used to 
			test the different mechanics.</p>

			<h2>Mechanics Progress</h2>
			<p>I’ve implemented basic functionality for the movement, crouch and jump mechanics, 
			allowing the player to traverse the makeshift environment with ease. I will continue to refine 
			these mechanics and iron out any rough patches.</p>

			<h2>Gunning it out</h2>
			<p>Basic versions of the aiming and shooting mechanic are now in place. The player can aim where they
			want the projectile to be fired by moving the mouse anywhere on the screen. Using the mouse
			button the player can fire the projectile. I think I have made some solid progress today and will
			continue working on the mechanics later tonight.</p>
