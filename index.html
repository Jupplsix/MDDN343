			<h2>First Thoughts</h2>
			<p>Just been given the brief, and I’m feeling good about this year! Last year has given me a solid understanding of Unity to work from, so this year I can concentrate on ideation and iteration, rather than learning the very basics of Unity's functionality and syntax.</p>

			<p>I think that one of the more challenging aspects of this project will be the ideation step. Coming up with an idea that I feel is solid, takes time, and we only have about two weeks max. However, once I have that idea, I can start working. From there I think it should become a lot easier, as I can easily spend hours on a project I care about, and love every second of it.</p>

			<h2>Dead Ideas</h2>
			<p>Lots of ideas have past, none that I’m particularly enthused about. I do know however that I will be continuing to pursue 2D game development. I think that with the given timeframe, and the amount of work I need to achieve for most of my ideas, 2D will be the best option, as I can eliminate the need for 3D modelling and texturing, as well as a lot of rigging. So as of now, there have been no ideas set in stone.</p>

			<h2>Just in Time</h2>
			<p>I've been brainstorming ideas for good few days now, most idea are now gone and dead, but there was one in particular that I am keen to pursue!</p>

			<p>Trigger Finger is a 2D Competitive Action game that pits two players head to head, in quick best of five matches, where both players attempt to down one another. Players are only equipped with a single weapon, a knife, and a few consumables. The weapons have limited ammo, after which players will have to resort to using a knife. Consumables would include stationary shields, grenades and bounce pads. Players will be given a rank based on long term wins and losses.</p>

			<p>This game will be multiplayer only. I will have to learn about the technical side of matchmaking systems, apart from that I think that I have enough time to create a decent prototype to show off most of the game features.</p>

			<h2>Game Design Document</h2>
			<p>I've started on the GDD for Trigger Finger, and have approval from the lecturer to go ahead with the idea. I am keen to start working on this project, and will dediciate most of the next three days towards finishing up the GDD to an acceptable standard.</p>

			<h2>Almost Finished</h2>
			<p>Most of the game design document is completed. I think I have a decent amount of detail, and clear explainations of game concepts and gameplay.
			I will continue to work on the GDD throughout tomorrow because I havn't done as much as I would like to today due to being sick. I will be adding some concept images of in-game items tomorrow as well.</p>
